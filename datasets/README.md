# Datasets

The `\datasets` folder is for the benchmark instances and real-world instances used in the paper.

The benchmark instances can be available at [link](https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/9822).

While for the real-world instances (welding car door instances), we generate them based on the targets positions provided by Prof. Béla Vizvári with different disk radii : 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50.

In the instance file, each line represents the target information with the format: `x y z r`.
